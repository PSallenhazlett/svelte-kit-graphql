# Svelte Kit GraphQL

This is a basic Svelte Kit project that uses the GraphQL endpoints used in my [net-graphql](https://github.com/PSallenhazlett/net-graphql) repository.

## Running

These are the commands that you need to run in order to run the project.

```
npm install

npm run dev -- --open
```

## GraphQL Endpoint

The URL to the GraphQL endpoint in stored in the `src/lib/server/graphql.server.ts` file, if it needs to be changed.
